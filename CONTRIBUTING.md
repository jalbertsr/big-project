# Contributing

We love pull requests from everyone. By participating in this project, you
agree to abide by the code of conduct.

[code of conduct]: https://thoughtbot.com/open-source-code-of-conduct


## How to contribute by making pull request?

- Create a new branch with the prefix ("fix/ or feature/") following by the name of your branch.
- The name of the branch must be in lowercase, with a short and clear description.
- Example: feature/name-of-your-branch
- The PR (pull request) must be done in develop branch, never in master.
- Once you made the pull request, the changes must be reviewed by at least two contributors.
- Finally, if the review passed, you should merge the pull request with develop branch, and delete your current branch.

We like to at least comment on pull requests within three business days. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write tests.
* Follow our [style guide][style]. 
* Write a [good commit message][commit].
